    <p>Our beloved founder Rajat Tripathi is the Supreme Leader and the maalik-maalik of the humble company as we dont have any ridiculous concept of the CEO. He hates America as much as he loves Demark(Or just he loves some Danish?)</p>
    <p>A ridiculous fan of DC comics and Marvel movies he would someday like to see some great action in face of the Injustic Universe inhabited by Marvel movies guys as in his own word "Damn that some great shit"</p>
<<<<<<< HEAD>
    <p>As for his ambition he is working for a hostile takeover from other maaliks due to rejection of his idea of 'SMF: An Invictus Subsidiary' to 'Invictus: A SMF subsidiary'. In somewhat his own words the takeover is majorly a revenge for Parth not letting him play Tekken 7 with Keyboard</p>
